# Victory Battle
Time travel complicates who wins the battles, because even after your ship is defeated, there is the possibility to turn back time.

## Time travel limiations
### Carrier ship
Since Time travel is bound to a time traveling engine, and powering it requires a TON of energy, 
time travel can be initiated only through the player carrier ship(a battle ship may have remote controls).
Because of that Time travel is not possible once the player carrier ship is destroyed, and thus
the destruction of the carrier ships results in losing the game. 

### Laupeerium
Laupeerium is the resource required for traveling through time. Without it the time travel engine is useless.
The player utilizes a given amount of this resource, having it depleted does not automatically mean defeat,
but it takes away the power to rewind, or restart the round(In case the carrier ship is still alive).
Because of that, after the palyer controlled battleship is destroyed, the round is lost if there are any
enemies on the level.
(Not taking into consideration turrets on the carrier ship, which are presently not implemented)

### Enemies
The player is victorious when all enemies are destroyed, including the enemy carrier ship(if any)
